            Former Chief Justice Sushila Karki becomes Nepal's first female
            Prime Minister in an interim role following massive Gen Z-led
            anti-corruption protests that ousted Oli. She was initially chosen

            president, but ended up being appointed as PM instead, aiming to
            restore order after years of power-hungry leadership that failed the
            nation. However, her government has faced general discontent for not
            addressing the mandates of the protests, failing to arrest the
            culprits responsible for the killings during the unrest, and
            focusing primarily on upcoming elections, resulting in growing
